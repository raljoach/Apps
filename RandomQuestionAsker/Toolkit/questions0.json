You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.\r\n\r\n2. You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r\n\r\nYou have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r\n\r\nThe input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n41111921111119\r\n11119 11119\r\n\r\nIf the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nCenter of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses:\r\nDistance: 12345678\r\nMass: 22241211\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15\r\nWeighted sum of the masses:\r\n2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60\r\nWeighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r\n\r\nThis means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r\n\r\nHere is an example problem:\r\n\r\n131251141231\r\n---- ----\r\n\r\nIf we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231.

The Eye has contacted you. Yes, the secret organisation mentioned in \"Now you see me\" ( don't tell anyone they are real !! )\r\n\r\nYou remember the string you memorised back then. You must reconstruct the binary tree T. You are also given a string A. All the characters of A are uppercase English alphabets. Let us assume that T has L leaves. Then, there will be exactly L paths from the root to the leaves - 1 unique path to each leaf.\r\n\r\nYou have to tell The Eye the number of paths out of L, on which, A exists as a sub-sequence. Look at the explanation for the Sample Case 1 for clarity.\r\n\r\nYou have to implement the method explodePaths in the code. explodePaths is passed the following parameters, respectively\r\n\r\nN, the number of nodes in T\r\nS, the string representation of the post-order traversal of T. Of course, the length of S will be equal to N.\r\nK, the length of the string A\r\nA, the string you must find in the paths from the root of T, to the leaves in T.\r\nNote\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that T is balanced. But, each internal node always has exactly 2 children. It is possible that both those children are internal nodes also. It is possible that only one of those children is an internal node.\r\nFor the given string S, because of the constraint that each internal node has exactly 2 children, you will always be able to determine the tree T, uniquely.\r\nIt is not necessary that all characters in T are unique. There may be several nodes with the same value.\r\nIn this problem statement, by sub-sequence we mean not necessarily contiguous.

Question is as follows.\r\n\r\nYou want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.\r\n\r\nYou want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.\r\n\r\nYou want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r\n\r\nYou have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r\n\r\nThe input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n41111921111119\r\n11119 11119\r\n\r\nIf the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r\n\r\nCenter of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r\n\r\nThis means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r\n\r\nHere is an example problem:\r\n\r\n131251141231 ---- ----\r\n\r\nIf we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5\r\n\r\nThis puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is\r\n\r\n0 8 4\r\n\r\nBecause the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15501897"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Suppose a customer buys items for $10 in a shop and the cashier swipe her card at a POS charging $10.

Then, when you start the robot, it will walk in the given direction till it gets out of the grid or encounters a \"turn\" cell in the grid.\r\nEach cell in the grid is either empty (depicted by '.') or a turn cell (depicted by 'r' or 'l'). When the robot encounters a turn cell with 'r', it will turn right on that cell. Note that this turn will be relative to the direction in which the robot is moving. Similarly, when the robot encounters a turn cell with 'l', it will turn left on that cell. The examples and explanations clarify this.\r\nThe robot will eventually leave the grid or enter a loop. You wish to choose a start point and direction for the robot such that it visits the maximum number of unique cells.

The scores or grades in this\r\nexamination form the basis of their entry to the College or University\r\nsystem, for an undergraduate program. At the K-12 level, students\r\nappear for examination in five subjects. These five subjects generally\r\ninclude one language; three elective subjects oriented towards Science,\r\nCommerce or Humanities; and any elective of their choice as a fifth\r\nsubject.\r\nThe Challenge\r\nThis challenge is based on real school data of the CBSE Class 12\r\nexamination conducted in the year 2013. You are given the grades\r\nobtained by students with specific but popular combinations of subjects\r\n(and all these students had opted for Mathematics). Their grades in four\r\nsubjects are known to you. However their grade in Mathematics (i.e, the\r\nfifth subject) is hidden.\r\nThe records provided to you are the grades obtained by students who\r\nhad opted for the following combinations of subjects or courses and\r\nobtained a passing grade in each subject. The individual subjects in the\r\ndata are:\r\nEnglish, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, Biology,\r\nPhysical Education, Economics, Accountancy and Business Studies.\r\nThe most dominant subject combinations, account for approximately\r\n99% of the data are:\r\nEnglish, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physical Education\r\nEnglish, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Economics\r\nEnglish, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology\r\nEnglish, Economics, Accountancy, Mathematics, Business Studie\r\ns\r\nThe grades of students in four subjects (other than Mathematics) are\r\nprovided to you. Can you predict what grade they had obtained in\r\nMathematics?\r\nTo help you build a prediction engine, we will provide you with a training\r\nfile, containing the grade points obtained by students with the above\r\nsubject combinations, in all five subjects.\r\nNotes about the Grading System\r\nThe student is first assessed on a scale of 100. (S)He needs a score of at\r\nleast 33% to pass in the subject. Among those who pass:\r\nGrade 1 is assigned to the top one-eighth of students who pas\r\ns the course.\r\nGrade 2 is assigned to the next one-eighth of students who pa\r\nss the course.\r\n.....\r\nGrade 8 is assigned to the last one-eighth of students who pa\r\nss the course.\r\nIf more than 1 student share the same score and lie in the margin, they\r\nshare the higher grade.\r\nInput Format\r\nThe first line will be an integer N. N lines follow each line being a valid\r\nJSON object. The following fields of raw data are given in json.\r\nSerialNumber (Numeric): The identifier of the student record.\r\nThis is provided just for identification purposes and does n\r\not have any direct use.\r\nEnglish (numeric) : The grade (between 1 and 8) obtained in E\r\nnglish. This will always be present.\r\nThree more numeric fields from among: Physics, Chemistry, Com\r\nputerScience, Hindi, Biology, PhysicalEducation, Economics, A\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\nThe input for each record has the grade for all subjects opted by a\r\nstudent, other than Mathematics which you have to predict as the\r\nanswer.\r\nConstraints\r\n1 <= N <= 10\r\nThe SerialNumber field will contain a unique numeric identifier such\r\nthat 1 <= SerialNumber <= 5 * 10 .\r\nAll other fields in the JSON fragment will represent the grades obtained\r\nin four subjects and will be populated by numeric values between 1 and\r\n8, both inclusive.\r\nOutput Format\r\nFor each student record that is given as a JSON object, containing the\r\ngrade obtained in four subjects, output the predicted grade in\r\nMathematics (this will be a numeral between 1 and 8, both inclusive) in\r\na newline.\r\nTraining File and Sample Tests\r\nThe training file with sample test data is available here.\r\nThe three files in this package are:\r\ntraining.json\r\nsample-test.in.json\r\nsample-test.out.json\r\nTraining data as well as sample testcases have been provided in the\r\nabove file for offline training and to help you build your prediction\r\nmodel.

If p = 0 or 1 your\r\nanswer for that particular student record will be considered correct. i.e,\r\nwe allow a tolerance of one grade point away from the correct answer,\r\nto take into consideration the marginal errors which might occur during\r\nthe testing or grading process.\r\nScore = 100 * ((C-W)/N)\r\nWhere C = Number of Correct predictions, not more than one grade\r\npoint away from the actual grade point assigned.\r\nW = Number of wrong (incorrect) predictions and\r\nN = Total number of records in the input.\r\nWhile the contest is in progress, only the score based on the sample\r\ntest case will be displayed to you. After the contest is completed, we\r\nwill revise the scores based on performance on a hidden test set only.\r\nHowever, when you make submissions, you will be able to see whether\r\nyour program attains a positive score on both the sample and the\r\nhidden test cases (to avoid a situation where unexpected errors occur\r\non the hidden test set at the end).\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5170652388524032"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Given an array int32 arr[] of size n, return the number of non-empty contigious subarrays whose sum lies in range [a, b]\r\n\r\nThat is, implement the following naive algorithm faster than O(n^2)\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5200686994161664"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Write Program for String Permutations using most efficient algorithm.

For e.g. Seller can say 'Hey, my brand name has changed to New_Brand', 'Hey, My Product P1 weight has changed to 6kg'. The catalog manager service has it's own datastore and cache in place where it goes and update accordingly. Imagine the sclae of these update requests to be very high as we have thousands of sellers and millions of products and each may have 50-60 attributes which could be chaned. The CatalogManager service is able to handle all these updates smartly.\r\n\r\nTO DESIGN:\r\nThere are various other back-end services (ShippingService, SearchService) in the system who must me notified about these changes in REAL TIME. For e.g. ShippingService must be notified by CatalogManager that 'Hey, Product P1 of seller S1 weight has changed to 6 kg'. Other example, SearchService must be notified that 'Hey, Seller S1 brand name has changed to New_Brand' so that it can change it's index to be searched.\r\n\r\n* Design such a system which can scale & is fault tolerant ensuring all edge cases including one mentioned below:-\r\n\r\n* Every back-end service may not be interested in all the events. It may only wish to listen subset of attributes. E.g. ShippingService may only want if product dimension related attributes change. So how will you ensure that only related messages reach to consumer services?\r\n\r\n* How will you ensure that event message published by producer service (CatalogManager) reacheed to the related consumer service for sure and in REAL TIME?\r\n\r\n* How can you ensure the messages passed to backend services are in sync (in order it's important)\r\n\r\n* How to ensure that same event is not messaged twice to the consumers? Although, eventually it will result in same data state but still looking at scale of the events this would be a burden to backend system\r\n\r\nHow would you design such a system?\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5987787134205952"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Design a data structure for following operations in O(1) time.:\r\ninsert\r\nremove (FIFO)\r\nfind MODE\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=6401882882834432"},{"Company":"all","Text":"1> write program to calculate power(x,n) in log(n) time\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5733237978562560"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Given a set of n people, find the celebrity.\r\nCelebrity is a person who:\r\n1.

Tukro a famous online social networking site founded in the year 3072 was celebrating its 1024th anniversary. To celebrate the occasion its CEO, Shark, and his team had launched a unique personalised video of length 17min 4sec for each user. The video consisted of a collage of all popular posts made by the user on Tukro.\r\n\r\nRaka shared this video with all his friends without reviewing it. Immediately after he finished watching the 1024 second length clip he realised that he made a huge mistake. The video was made of all posts made by Raka, irrespective of the privacy settings of the individual post.\r\n\r\nA post is compromised if a friend who was not supposed to see the original post, has seen it now. Raka wants to know how many of his posts have been compromised. Tukro provides the list of users who have watched the video till now. Help Raka find how many posts were compromised.\r\n\r\nRaka has N friends, identified by a unique integer between 0 and N-1.\r\n\r\nRaka has L lists of friends, identified by a unique integer between 0 and L-1.\r\n\r\nEach list can be of length at the most N.\r\nOne friend cannot be added more than once to the same list.\r\nA list must have at least one friend.\r\nA friend may be added to multiple lists.\r\nVisibility of a post in Tukro works through two filters\r\n\r\nInclude Filter: An array of lists, from the L lists above. Friends can view a post if they belong to any friend list, specified in the Include Filter.\r\nExclude Filter: An array of lists, from the L lists above. Friends can view a post if their name does not belong to any friend list, specified in the Exclude Filter.\r\nSome caveats of the above are\r\n\r\nIf no Filter is active, the post is visible to all friends\r\nIf only Include Filter is active, a friend can see the post only if he is present in at least one of the lists of Include Filter.\r\nIf only Exclude Filter is active, a friend can see the post only if he is not present in any of the lists of exclude filter.\r\nIf both Include and Exclude Filters are active, a friend can see the post if and only if\r\nhe is present in at least one of the lists of include filter and\r\nhe is not present in any of the lists of exclude filter\r\nif he is present in both an include filter list, and exclude filter list, he should not be able to see the post\r\nInput Specification\r\n\r\nFirst line contains a single integer N, the number of friends.\r\n\r\nSecond line contains a list of integers separated by a single space. The first integer V, represents the number of friends who viewed the video. There are V other integers in the line representing the ID's of friends who viewed the video.\r\n\r\nThird line contains a single integer L representing the number of lists.\r\n\r\nL lines follow. Each line representing a list. The first integer of the line A, denotes the size of the list; followed by A integers, each denoting the friends in the list.\r\n\r\nNext line contains a single integer P denoting the number of posts in the video. 2 * P lines follow.

You used something similar to the pseudocode below\r\n\r\ntoPostOrderString (node)\r\nif node is leaf\r\nreturn node.value\r\nelse\r\nT = \"\"\r\nT = T + toPostOrderString(node.left)\r\nT = T + toPostOrderString(node.right)\r\nT = T + node.value\r\nreturn T\r\nNow, time has come to use that string again. The Eye has contacted you. Yes, the secret organisation mentioned in \"Now you see me\" ( don't tell anyone they are real !! )\r\n\r\nYou remember the string you memorised back then. You must reconstruct the binary tree T. You are also given a string A. All the characters of A are uppercase English alphabets. Let us assume that T has L leaves. Then, there will be exactly L paths from the root to the leaves - 1 unique path to each leaf.\r\n\r\nYou have to tell The Eye the number of paths out of L, on which, A exists as a sub-sequence. Look at the explanation for the Sample Case 1 for clarity.\r\n\r\nYou have to implement the method explodePaths in the code. explodePaths is passed the following parameters, respectively\r\n\r\nN, the number of nodes in T\r\nS, the string representation of the post-order traversal of T. Of course, the length of S will be equal to N.\r\nK, the length of the string A\r\nA, the string you must find in the paths from the root of T, to the leaves in T.\r\nNote\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that T is balanced. But, each internal node always has exactly 2 children. It is possible that both those children are internal nodes also. It is possible that only one of those children is an internal node.\r\nFor the given string S, because of the constraint that each internal node has exactly 2 children, you will always be able to determine the tree T, uniquely.\r\nIt is not necessary that all characters in T are unique. There may be several nodes with the same value.\r\nIn this problem statement, by sub-sequence we mean not necessarily contiguous. This is different from a sub-string.\r\nDo not print the answer in explodePaths. Just return the value. The code-template interviewstreet provides does the input and output itself.\r\nConsider the following tree\r\n\r\nA\r\n/ \\\r\nt B\r\n/ \\\r\n/ \\\r\nB A\r\n/ \\ / \\\r\nx y a b\r\nThis tree is given in Sample Case 1 as\r\n\r\nN = 9\r\nS = \"txyBabABA\"\r\nK = 2\r\nA = \"AA\"\r\nNow, there are 5 leaf nodes, and hence, 5 paths from the root to leaves - 1 for each leaf.\r\n\r\n- A-t\r\n- A-B-B-x\r\n- A-B-B-y\r\n- A-B-A-a\r\n- A-B-A-b\r\nOut of these 5 paths, you have to find the number of paths, on which \"AA\" exists as a sub-sequence. Of course, there are only 2 such paths\r\n\r\n- A-B-A-a\r\n- A-B-A-b\r\nHence the expected answer is 2.\r\n\r\nIn the same T above\r\n\r\nThe answer for A = \"BB\", is 2\r\nThe answer for A = \"BA\", is 2\r\nThe answer for A = \"AB\", is 4\r\nThe answer for K = 1 and A = \"A\", is 5\r\nThe answer for K = 1 and A = \"B\", is 4\r\nThe Sample Case 2 has a little more complicated T. The string S in Sample Case 2 is yeBgeuCBxAB.\r\n\r\nConstraints\r\n\r\nN ≤ 10000\r\nK ≤ 100\r\nThe expected time complexity of the algorithm is O(N).\r\n\r\n","Url":"Question 1 / 1 (Path Explosion EASY)"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Input - array of integers size N, integer Threshold.

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.\r\n\r\nLuckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput Specifications\r\nThe input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):\r\n<location name> <probability>probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.\r\n\r\nThe file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:\r\n<location name> <location name> <seconds> The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.\r\n\r\nExample input file:\r\n4\r\nfront_door .2\r\nin_cabinet .3\r\nunder_bed .4\r\nbehind_blinds .1\r\n5\r\nfront_door under_bed 5\r\nunder_bed behind_blinds 9\r\nfront_door behind_blinds 5\r\nfront_door in_cabinet 2\r\nin_cabinet behind_blinds 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput Specifications\r\nYour output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n6.00\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=9672248"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Gattaca\r\nYou have a DNA string that you wish to analyze. Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput Specification\r\nYour program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.\r\n\r\nThe first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.\r\n\r\nThe next ceiling(n / 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.\r\n\r\nBeing an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.\r\n\r\nWrite a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput specifications\r\nThe input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.\r\n\r\nExample input file:\r\n1 0.0 0.0\r\n2 10.1 -10.1\r\n3 -12.2 12.2\r\n4 38.3 38.3\r\n5 79.99 179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput specifications\r\nIn the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces.

You realize that such a program would be of great use to society and intend to resolve the problem once and for all. The program you write must compute a score for a body of text, returning this score upon completion.\r\n\r\nYour program will be given a list of accepted words and run on one wall post at a time. For each word W in the post, you must find word W' from the list of accepted words such that the number of changes from W to W' is minimized. It is possible that W is already W' and thus the number of changes necessary is zero. A change is defined as replacing a single letter with another letter, adding a letter in any position, or removing a letter from any position. The total score for the wall post is the minimum number of changes necessary to make all words in the post acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\nInput Specification\r\nYour program must take a single string argument, representing the file name containing the wall post to analyze. In addition, your program must open up and read the accepted word list from the following static path location:\r\n\r\n/var/tmp/twl06.txt\r\n\r\nFor testing purposes, you may download and examine the accepted word list here. When submitting your code, you do not need to include this file, as it is already present on the machine.\r\n\r\nThe input file consists entirely of lower case letters and space characters. You are guaranteed that the input file will start with a lower case letter, and that all words are separated by at least one space character. The file may or may not end with a new line character.\r\n\r\nExample input file:\r\n\r\ntihs sententcnes iss nout varrry goud\r\n\r\nYou are guaranteed that your program will run against well formed input files and that the accepted word list is identical to the one provided for testing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput Specification\r\nYour program must print out the minimum number of changes necessary to turn all words in the input wall post into accepted words as defined by the word list file. Words may not be joined together, or separated into multiple words. A change in a word is defined as one of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Replacing any single letter with another letter.\r\n2. Adding a single letter in any position.\r\n3. Removing any single letter.\r\n\r\nThis score must be printed out as an integer and followed by a single new line.\r\n\r\nExample Output (newline after number):\r\n\r\n8\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=9634795"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Given a BST and integer value K.\r\nFind two nodes x and y such that x->data + y->data = K\r\nTime O(n), space O(1)\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=9555894"},{"Company":"all","Text":"You have a digital clock having 24 hr format of HH:MM:SS.

You are also given a robot which is very small and can be placed on the grid - to walk around in the grid. You will place the robot at some starting cell of your choosing. You will give the robot an initial direction. Then, when you start the robot, it will walk in the given direction till it gets out of the grid or encounters a \"turn\" cell in the grid.\r\nEach cell in the grid is either empty (depicted by '.') or a turn cell (depicted by 'r' or 'l'). When the robot encounters a turn cell with 'r', it will turn right on that cell. Note that this turn will be relative to the direction in which the robot is moving. Similarly, when the robot encounters a turn cell with 'l', it will turn left on that cell. The examples and explanations clarify this.\r\nThe robot will eventually leave the grid or enter a loop. You wish to choose a start point and direction for the robot such that it visits the maximum number of unique cells. Note that the start point you select must be an empty cell.\r\nPrint the maximum number of unique cells the robot will visit when you choose such a starting point.\r\nInput\r\nThe first line of input contains a number T, the number of test cases. Then follows the description of T test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers R and C. On the next R lines are exactly C characters each. Each character is either '.', 'r' or 'l'.\r\nOutput\r\nFor each test case, output a single number on a line by itself.

At the K-12 level, students\r\nappear for examination in five subjects. These five subjects generally\r\ninclude one language; three elective subjects oriented towards Science,\r\nCommerce or Humanities; and any elective of their choice as a fifth\r\nsubject.\r\nThe Challenge\r\nThis challenge is based on real school data of the CBSE Class 12\r\nexamination conducted in the year 2013.

In the question here, we are concerned with the following, related problem: First n straws are dumped on the table. Next, for every pair of straws, we want to determine if the straws are connected by a path of touching straws. In other words, given a list of the endpoints for n > 1 straws (as if they were dumped on a large piece of graph paper), determine all the pairs of straws that are connected. Note that touching is connecting, but also two straws can be connected indirectly via other connected straws. Give an algorithm to compute all the pairs of straws that are connected.\r\nHere is some additional information that you can use:\r\n\r\nAs a basic step you need to determine whether two straws directly touch (intersect), i.e., whether straw ab with end points a and b intersects with straw cd (with end points c and d).\r\nTo get full credit also explain how the elementary step i) can be done. If you cannot find an algorithm for this step, assume an O(n 2 ) algorithm and explain how to find all pairs of straws that are connected.\r\nAnalyse and explain the worst-case computational complexity of your algorithm in terms of n.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=6267011938123776"},{"Company":"all","Text":"You are given a catalog of books, which have following attributes.\r\nName\r\nAuthor\r\nPublisher\r\nPublish year\r\nCategory\r\nPrice\r\nCount (sold)\r\nImplement following APIs on top of this catalog\r\naddBookToCatalog(Book)\r\nsearchBook(by partial book name/author)\r\ngetMostSoldBooks(by author name/category, limit)\r\nExpectations:\r\nMaintain DB on memory\r\nCode should be readable.

For e.g. Seller can say 'Hey, my brand name has changed to New_Brand', 'Hey, My Product P1 weight has changed to 6kg'. The catalog manager service has it's own datastore and cache in place where it goes and update accordingly. Imagine the sclae of these update requests to be very high as we have thousands of sellers and millions of products and each may have 50-60 attributes which could be chaned. The CatalogManager service is able to handle all these updates smartly.\r\n\r\nTO DESIGN:\r\nThere are various other back-end services (ShippingService, SearchService) in the system who must me notified about these changes in REAL TIME. For e.g. ShippingService must be notified by CatalogManager that 'Hey, Product P1 of seller S1 weight has changed to 6 kg'. Other example, SearchService must be notified that 'Hey, Seller S1 brand name has changed to New_Brand' so that it can change it's index to be searched.\r\n\r\n* Design such a system which can scale & is fault tolerant ensuring all edge cases including one mentioned below:-\r\n\r\n* Every back-end service may not be interested in all the events. It may only wish to listen subset of attributes. E.g. ShippingService may only want if product dimension related attributes change. So how will you ensure that only related messages reach to consumer services?\r\n\r\n* How will you ensure that event message published by producer service (CatalogManager) reacheed to the related consumer service for sure and in REAL TIME?\r\n\r\n* How can you ensure the messages passed to backend services are in sync (in order it's important)\r\n\r\n* How to ensure that same event is not messaged twice to the consumers? Although, eventually it will result in same data state but still looking at scale of the events this would be a burden to backend system\r\n\r\nHow would you design such a system?\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5987787134205952"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Design a data structure for following operations in O(1) time.:\r\ninsert\r\nremove (FIFO)\r\nfind MODE\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=6401882882834432"},{"Company":"all","Text":"1> write program to calculate power(x,n) in log(n) time\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5733237978562560"},{"Company":"all","Text":"Given a set of n people, find the celebrity.\r\nCelebrity is a person who:\r\n1.

Tukro a famous online social networking site founded in the year 3072 was celebrating its 1024th anniversary. To celebrate the occasion its CEO, Shark, and his team had launched a unique personalised video of length 17min 4sec for each user. The video consisted of a collage of all popular posts made by the user on Tukro.\r\n\r\nRaka shared this video with all his friends without reviewing it. Immediately after he finished watching the 1024 second length clip he realised that he made a huge mistake. The video was made of all posts made by Raka, irrespective of the privacy settings of the individual post.\r\n\r\nA post is compromised if a friend who was not supposed to see the original post, has seen it now. Raka wants to know how many of his posts have been compromised. Tukro provides the list of users who have watched the video till now. Help Raka find how many posts were compromised.\r\n\r\nRaka has N friends, identified by a unique integer between 0 and N-1.\r\n\r\nRaka has L lists of friends, identified by a unique integer between 0 and L-1.\r\n\r\nEach list can be of length at the most N.\r\nOne friend cannot be added more than once to the same list.\r\nA list must have at least one friend.\r\nA friend may be added to multiple lists.\r\nVisibility of a post in Tukro works through two filters\r\n\r\nInclude Filter: An array of lists, from the L lists above. Friends can view a post if they belong to any friend list, specified in the Include Filter.\r\nExclude Filter: An array of lists, from the L lists above. Friends can view a post if their name does not belong to any friend list, specified in the Exclude Filter.\r\nSome caveats of the above are\r\n\r\nIf no Filter is active, the post is visible to all friends\r\nIf only Include Filter is active, a friend can see the post only if he is present in at least one of the lists of Include Filter.\r\nIf only Exclude Filter is active, a friend can see the post only if he is not present in any of the lists of exclude filter.\r\nIf both Include and Exclude Filters are active, a friend can see the post if and only if\r\nhe is present in at least one of the lists of include filter and\r\nhe is not present in any of the lists of exclude filter\r\nif he is present in both an include filter list, and exclude filter list, he should not be able to see the post\r\nInput Specification\r\n\r\nFirst line contains a single integer N, the number of friends.\r\n\r\nSecond line contains a list of integers separated by a single space. The first integer V, represents the number of friends who viewed the video. There are V other integers in the line representing the ID's of friends who viewed the video.\r\n\r\nThird line contains a single integer L representing the number of lists.\r\n\r\nL lines follow. Each line representing a list. The first integer of the line A, denotes the size of the list; followed by A integers, each denoting the friends in the list.\r\n\r\nNext line contains a single integer P denoting the number of posts in the video. 2 * P lines follow.

You must reconstruct the binary tree T. You are also given a string A. All the characters of A are uppercase English alphabets. Let us assume that T has L leaves.

But, each internal node always has exactly 2 children. It is possible that both those children are internal nodes also. It is possible that only one of those children is an internal node.\r\nFor the given string S, because of the constraint that each internal node has exactly 2 children, you will always be able to determine the tree T, uniquely.\r\nIt is not necessary that all characters in T are unique. There may be several nodes with the same value.\r\nIn this problem statement, by sub-sequence we mean not necessarily contiguous.

I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time.\r\nEven that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy.

You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.\r\n\r\n2. You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r\n\r\nYou have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r\n\r\nThe input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n41111921111119\r\n11119 11119\r\n\r\nIf the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nCenter of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses:\r\nDistance: 12345678\r\nMass: 22241211\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15\r\nWeighted sum of the masses:\r\n2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60\r\nWeighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r\n\r\nThis means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r\n\r\nHere is an example problem:\r\n\r\n131251141231\r\n---- ----\r\n\r\nIf we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14\r\nWeight sum of the masses:\r\n2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63\r\nWeighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5\r\n\r\nThis puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is\r\n\r\n0 8 4\r\n\r\nBecause the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5745799489126400"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"/**\r\n* Implement a function OneEditApart with the following signature:\r\n* bool OneEditApart(string s1, string s2)\r\n*\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"dog\") = false\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"cats\") = true\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"cut\") = true\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"cast\") = true\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"at\") = true\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"acts\") = false\r\n* Edit is: insertion, removal, replacement\r\n*/\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=4793416529477632"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given an array of words, write a method that determines whether there are any words in this array that are anagrams of each other.\r\n\r\nSample #1: @[@\"bag\", @\"bat\", @\"tab\"]; // output TRUE\r\n\r\nSample #2: @[@\"gab\", @\"bat\", @\"laf\"]; // output FALSE\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5654505932718080"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"An UIView A2 is subclassed from the same parent as an UIView A1.\r\n\r\nGiven inputs of A1, A2, and an UIView that is in the tree of UIViews of A1 somewhere, return the exact UIView that mirrors this in A2.\r\n\r\nExample setup:\r\n\r\nA1------------\r\n| |\r\nUIView UIView\r\n|\r\nUIView <-- Given this\r\n\r\nA2------------\r\n| |\r\nUIView UIView\r\n|\r\nUIView <-- Find/return this\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5979809976942592"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a list of n sorted lists of numbers, write a method that returns one giant list of all the numbers in order.\r\n\r\nExample input:\r\n\r\nNSArray* input = @[\r\n@[@2, @5, @10],\r\n@[@25, @100, @105],\r\n@[@7, @56, @42],\r\n.......\r\n];\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5650339814440960"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given the following hashmap for numeric to alpha translation of a telephone keypad:\r\n\r\nNSDictionary* dict = @{@2: @[@\"A\", @\"B\", @\"C\"],\r\n@3: @[@\"D\", @\"E\", @\"F\"],\r\n@4: @[@\"G\", @\"H\", @\"I\"],\r\n@5: @[@\"J\", @\"K\", @\"L\"],\r\n@6: @[@\"M\", @\"N\", @\"O\"],\r\n@7: @[@\"P\", @\"Q\", @\"R\", @\"S\"],\r\n@8: @[@\"T\", @\"U\", @\"V\"],\r\n@9: @[@\"W\", @\"X\", @\"Y\", @\"Z\"]};\r\n\r\nWrite a method that takes a phone number as input and returns all possible letter combinations for that phone number.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=6273398908911616"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a current absolute path, e.g., \"/usr/bin/mail\", and a relative one, e.g, \"../../../etc/xyz/../abc\" return the absolute path created from the combination of the first two paths.

Here is an example:\r\n\r\n41111921111119\r\n11119 11119\r\n\r\nIf the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r\n\r\nCenter of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r\n\r\nThis means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r\n\r\nHere is an example problem:\r\n\r\n131251141231 ---- ----\r\n\r\nIf we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5\r\n\r\nThis puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is\r\n\r\n0 8 4\r\n\r\nBecause the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15501897"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given n, output the numbers from 0 to 2^n-1 (inclusive) in n-bit binary form, in such an order that adjacent numbers in the list differ by exactly 1 bit.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15532723"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given an expression (in single variable) like 4x+13(x-(4x+x/3)) = 9, evaluate x\r\nThe expression is a string and the variable is always x.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15468738"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a list of integer numbers, a list of symbols [+,-,*,/] and a target number N, provide an expression which evaluates to N or return False if that is not possible.\r\ne.g. let the list of numbers be [1,5,5] and the target number is 9, one possible solution could be 5+5-1.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15466752"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Design a realtime service that tells users which of their friends are currently online.\r\n\r\nYour service must implement two functions:\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15421954"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a hashmap M which is a mapping of characters to arrays of substitute characters, and an input string S, return an array of all possible mutations of S (where any character in S can be substituted with one of its substitutes in M, if it exists).\r\n\r\nWhat is the time complexity?

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.\r\n\r\nLuckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput Specifications\r\nThe input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):\r\n<location name> <probability>probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.\r\n\r\nThe file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:\r\n<location name> <location name> <seconds> The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.\r\n\r\nExample input file:\r\n4\r\nfront_door .2\r\nin_cabinet .3\r\nunder_bed .4\r\nbehind_blinds .1\r\n5\r\nfront_door under_bed 5\r\nunder_bed behind_blinds 9\r\nfront_door behind_blinds 5\r\nfront_door in_cabinet 2\r\nin_cabinet behind_blinds 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput Specifications\r\nYour output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n6.00\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=9672248"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Gattaca\r\nYou have a DNA string that you wish to analyze.

No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).\r\n\r\nExample Input:\r\n100\r\nGAACTATCGCCCGTGCGCATCGCCCGTCCGACCGGCCGTAAGTCTATCTCCCGAGCGGGCGCCCGATCTCAAGTGCACCT\r\nCACGGCCTCACGACCGTGAG\r\n8\r\n43 70 27\r\n3 18 24\r\n65 99 45\r\n20 39 26\r\n45 74 26\r\n10 28 20\r\n78 97 23\r\n0 9 22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput Specification\r\nPrint to standard out the score of the best possible subset of the gene predictions you are given such that no single index in the DNA string is contained in more than one gene prediction, followed by a newline.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.\r\n\r\nBeing an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.\r\n\r\nWrite a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput specifications\r\nThe input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.\r\n\r\nExample input file:\r\n1 0.0 0.0\r\n2 10.1 -10.1\r\n3 -12.2 12.2\r\n4 38.3 38.3\r\n5 79.99 179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput specifications\r\nIn the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n1 2,3,4\r\n2 1,3,4\r\n3 1,2,4\r\n4 1,2,3\r\n5 4,3,1\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=9670311"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a node in a graph that is reachable, how do you find all the nodes that are reachable ?

Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane.

If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r\n\r\nHere is an example problem:\r\n\r\n131251141231\r\n---- ----\r\n\r\nIf we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14\r\nWeight sum of the masses:\r\n2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63\r\nWeighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5\r\n\r\nThis puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is\r\n\r\n0 8 4\r\n\r\nBecause the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=5745799489126400"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"/**\r\n* Implement a function OneEditApart with the following signature:\r\n* bool OneEditApart(string s1, string s2)\r\n*\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"dog\") = false\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"cats\") = true\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"cut\") = true\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"cast\") = true\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"at\") = true\r\n* OneEditApart(\"cat\", \"acts\") = false\r\n* Edit is: insertion, removal, replacement\r\n*/\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=4793416529477632"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a current absolute path, e.g., \"/usr/bin/mail\", and a relative one, e.g, \"../../../etc/xyz/../abc\" return the absolute path created from the combination of the first two paths.

Question is as follows.\r\n\r\nYou want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.\r\n\r\nYou want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.\r\n\r\nYou want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r\n\r\nYou have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r\n\r\nThe input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n41111921111119\r\n11119 11119\r\n\r\nIf the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r\n\r\nCenter of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r\n\r\nThis means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff.

You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r\n\r\nYou have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r\n\r\nThe input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch.

Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r\n\r\nThis means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r\n\r\nHere is an example problem:\r\n\r\n131251141231 ---- ----\r\n\r\nIf we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5\r\n\r\nThis puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is\r\n\r\n0 8 4\r\n\r\nBecause the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15501897"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given an expression (in single variable) like 4x+13(x-(4x+x/3)) = 9, evaluate x\r\nThe expression is a string and the variable is always x.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15468738"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a hashmap M which is a mapping of characters to arrays of substitute characters, and an input string S, return an array of all possible mutations of S (where any character in S can be substituted with one of its substitutes in M, if it exists).\r\n\r\nWhat is the time complexity?

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.\r\n\r\nBeing an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.\r\n\r\nWrite a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput specifications\r\nThe input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.\r\n\r\nExample input file:\r\n1 0.0 0.0\r\n2 10.1 -10.1\r\n3 -12.2 12.2\r\n4 38.3 38.3\r\n5 79.99 179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput specifications\r\nIn the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n1 2,3,4\r\n2 1,3,4\r\n3 1,2,4\r\n4 1,2,3\r\n5 4,3,1\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=9670311"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"There are N coins with coordinates (x, y) where x >0 and y >0\r\nYou start at (0, 0) and you can only do steps of form (dx, dy) where dx >0 and dy > 0\r\nPrint the maximum number of coins that you can collect.\r\n\r\nClarification: you can do as many moves as you wish, the point is to collect maximum number of coins.

You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r\n\r\nYou have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r\n\r\nThe input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n41111921111119\r\n11119 11119\r\n\r\nIf the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nCenter of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses:\r\nDistance: 12345678\r\nMass: 22241211\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15\r\nWeighted sum of the masses:\r\n2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60\r\nWeighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r\n\r\nThis means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r\n\r\nHere is an example problem:\r\n\r\n131251141231\r\n---- ----\r\n\r\nIf we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231.

Question is as follows.\r\n\r\nYou want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.\r\n\r\nYou want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.\r\n\r\nYou want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.\r\n\r\nYou have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.\r\n\r\nThe input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n41111921111119\r\n11119 11119\r\n\r\nIf the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.\r\n\r\nCenter of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4\r\n\r\nThis means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.\r\n\r\nHere is an example problem:\r\n\r\n131251141231 ---- ----\r\n\r\nIf we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231\r\n\r\nSum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5\r\n\r\nThis puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is\r\n\r\n0 8 4\r\n\r\nBecause the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15501897"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given n, output the numbers from 0 to 2^n-1 (inclusive) in n-bit binary form, in such an order that adjacent numbers in the list differ by exactly 1 bit.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15532723"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given an expression (in single variable) like 4x+13(x-(4x+x/3)) = 9, evaluate x\r\nThe expression is a string and the variable is always x.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15468738"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a list of integer numbers, a list of symbols [+,-,*,/] and a target number N, provide an expression which evaluates to N or return False if that is not possible.\r\ne.g. let the list of numbers be [1,5,5] and the target number is 9, one possible solution could be 5+5-1.\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15466752"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Design a realtime service that tells users which of their friends are currently online.\r\n\r\nYour service must implement two functions:\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=15421954"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a hashmap M which is a mapping of characters to arrays of substitute characters, and an input string S, return an array of all possible mutations of S (where any character in S can be substituted with one of its substitutes in M, if it exists).\r\n\r\nWhat is the time complexity?

Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds.\r\nBalance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds.\r\nBalance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.\r\n\r\nThe output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as follows:\r\n\r\n<index>: <weight added to left side> <weight added to right side>\r\n\r\nSo the output for this problem would be:\r\n\r\n0: 0 14\r\n1: 10 0\r\n2: 0 3\r\n3: 0 0\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=12150672"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"You are given a list of points in the plane, write a program that\r\noutputs each point along with the three other points that are closest\r\nto it.

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.\r\n\r\nLuckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput Specifications\r\nThe input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):\r\n<location name> <probability>probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.\r\n\r\nThe file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:\r\n<location name> <location name> <seconds> The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.\r\n\r\nExample input file:\r\n4\r\nfront_door .2\r\nin_cabinet .3\r\nunder_bed .4\r\nbehind_blinds .1\r\n5\r\nfront_door under_bed 5\r\nunder_bed behind_blinds 9\r\nfront_door behind_blinds 5\r\nfront_door in_cabinet 2\r\nin_cabinet behind_blinds 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput Specifications\r\nYour output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n6.00\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=9672248"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Gattaca\r\nYou have a DNA string that you wish to analyze. Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput Specification\r\nYour program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.\r\n\r\nThe first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.\r\n\r\nThe next ceiling(n / 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.\r\n\r\nThe next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.\r\n\r\nThe next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form\r\n<start> <stop> <score> representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).\r\n\r\nExample Input:\r\n100\r\nGAACTATCGCCCGTGCGCATCGCCCGTCCGACCGGCCGTAAGTCTATCTCCCGAGCGGGCGCCCGATCTCAAGTGCACCT\r\nCACGGCCTCACGACCGTGAG\r\n8\r\n43 70 27\r\n3 18 24\r\n65 99 45\r\n20 39 26\r\n45 74 26\r\n10 28 20\r\n78 97 23\r\n0 9 22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput Specification\r\nPrint to standard out the score of the best possible subset of the gene predictions you are given such that no single index in the DNA string is contained in more than one gene prediction, followed by a newline.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.\r\n\r\nBeing an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.\r\n\r\nWrite a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInput specifications\r\nThe input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.\r\n\r\nExample input file:\r\n1 0.0 0.0\r\n2 10.1 -10.1\r\n3 -12.2 12.2\r\n4 38.3 38.3\r\n5 79.99 179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput specifications\r\nIn the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n1 2,3,4\r\n2 1,3,4\r\n3 1,2,4\r\n4 1,2,3\r\n5 4,3,1\r\n","Url":"https://careercup.com/question?id=9670311"},{"Company":"fb","Text":"Given a node in a graph that is reachable, how do you find all the nodes that are reachable ?

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.\r\n\r\nWrite a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nInput specifications\r\n\r\nThe input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:\r\n<SKU label> <weight in pounds> <cost in dollars>\r\nSKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character.
